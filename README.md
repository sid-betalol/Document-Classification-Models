# Document-Classification-Models
Using streaming from HuggingFace to finetune document understanding models for classification
My target is to finetune the base models for classification on RVL-CDIP
These models are publicly available currently:
- DiT [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02378)]

I'll be making the notebooks for the following models available soon:
- Donut [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15664)]
- LayoutLM [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13318)] and its successors
